# Family Tree Application

## Overview
This application defines a simple family tree structure using JavaScript classes. 
It allows you to create family members, define parent-child relationships, update member details, and display descendants in a family tree. 
The primary classes used are `Person` and `FamilyTree`.

## Features
- Add family members with their names, birthdates, and optional details.
- Define parent-child relationships between family members.
- Update the details (name, birthdate, additional information) of family members.
- Display the descendants (children, grandchildren, etc.) of a specific family member.

## Difficulties
- Using a map for the first time was a little challenging, but it is far easier than using a Node-Tree setup to manage all of the attributes of a `Person`
- Had a little issue using the arrays to display the information, but the issue was simply using ".array.ForEach" instead of just ".ForEach"

## Wins
- First time using a map feels great!
- I really like the simplicity of a map vs node-tree setups.
